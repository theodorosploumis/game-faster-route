## How to Play
### 1 player
- Shuffle the cards and put them in a list without knowing their numbers.
- Set the fist and last card and place them at the start and end of the card list.
- Open all cards.
- Try to solve the TSP problem (from Start to End through points...) using the lace. 
- The first and last card should always stay there. Other cards can change positions to represent the route.

### 2+ Players
- For more than 1 player each player plays its turn and adds a mark (eg a small colored clip on the lace) at the end of the route.
- The player also writes down the order of her/his cards on a paper.
- The player to find the shortest route (lace comparison) wins the game.
